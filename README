This map is in an alpha build. It is an attempt at creating an interactive visualization documenting the effects of human presence around national parks.
	The map reads in a csv of count data and displays the data in the form of bubbles, describing the counts for a particular survey area by employing a D3 Force Layout. Hovering the pointer over a bubble will reveal more information pertaining to it's data.

	Still in development, data with zero counts still have bubbles. Although hovering the pointer reveals the zero count, this should not be the case. 

	Still in development is a key for the D3 visualization.

	Still in development is a deeper analysis of the data to display the effects of the national parks.

	Still in development is the ability to click directly on the survey areas and a proper responsive layout.
